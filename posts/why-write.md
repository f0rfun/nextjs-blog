We **don't** need a reason to. In the event you do need some:

- Just because we can. Being able to write is a priviledge. 
- How else are we suppose to articulate our thoughts?
- It takes time and practice to be able to write well. 

Let this canvas be a safe place for you to express your thoughts and opinions.

Anyways, Happy **10th** birthday 🎂, Skye.

舅舅, 舅母, Nathanael, Olivia & Joel
